1. Open Vscode
2. depending if you already have a project folder create a folder you want to store your project in
3. When you are in the welcome page click open folder
4. Find and click the folder you created
5. Under the open editor file there should be the name of your folder
6. To create a file hover over your folder
7. click the paper icon that has a plus button that is the create new file button
8. When you click it, you can name the file name it whatever you want then at the end add .language you want the file to be (ex. .php, .html, .css)
9. Now you are ready to use VScode
